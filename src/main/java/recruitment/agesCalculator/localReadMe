Assumptions:

1. Years provided as inputs to the methods should be only integers numbers.
2. For the method that calculate from the animal years to the human years the result is calculated to the nearest half.
Only for the age scope from 0 to 0.5 year it is always rounded up to 0.5.
It means that we do not use months as the result years but only the whole year or half parts.
3. The classes in the Helpers package are used by all "Animal's" method and can be modified easily.
4. Tests are written in three versions: Junit as three separate tests, Junit using abstract class as the main test class
and the last ones are written using Spock framework.
5. Java code was build based on Java 8 compiler.
6. Code was created in maven and is built successfully.
